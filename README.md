# Wallstream

Wallstream is meant to allow people to subscribe to someone else's wallpaper, where if they change theirs, yours downloads the new one and sets it on your computer.

## Roadmap

1. Host a central server somewhere and store the files in S3.
2. Prepare Docker Image for self-hosting.
3. Setup some sort of secure approval process before subscription (and the option to have public streams).
4. Officially maintained streams, such as Bing's daily wallpaper.
5. Monetize!!! Somehow! Or accept donations!
6. Maybe mobile support?!?!
